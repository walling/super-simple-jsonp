Super Simple JSONP
==================

This is a super simple implementation of JSONP in client-side JavaScript, which
handles errors in an elegant way. Read the below license, which is the closest
I get to releasing this software in the public domain.

The file `jsonp.js` contains the implementation. You can minify it if you want.

The file `jsonp-usage-example.js` is just an example how to use it to query
Flickr for cat pictures with a timeout of 2 seconds.
