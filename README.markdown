Super Simple JSONP
==================

This is a super simple implementation of JSONP in client-side JavaScript, which
handles errors in an elegant way. Read the below license, which is the closest
I get to releasing this software in the public domain.

The file `js_modules/jsonp.js` is the implementation. Minify it if you want.

The file `jsonp-usage-example.html` is just an example how to use it to query
Flickr for cat pictures with a timeout of 2 seconds.

Happy hacking!

Install
-------

Install it with Mud:

    npm install -g mud        # If you haven't already! :-)
    mud install jsonp         # Install this JavaScript module
    mud server                # Run local server, which enables development

Read more about Mud package manager at <http://mudhub.org/>.


Usage
-----

Look in the inline documentation or the example to see how you use it. For
local development, just start `mud server` and in your HTML:

    <script src="http://mudhub.org/dev"></script>
    <script>
      var jsonp = require('jsonp');
      // use it here
    </script>

To deploy, use `mud inline your.html` or to just minify the module:

    mud modules jsonp --global --compile > jsonp.min.js

You can also use --compile-advanced for more aggressive optimizations (which I
did not test yet). The minifier is Closure. Read more at the
[Mud website](http://mudhub.org/).


Error handling
--------------

If the connection fails, the URL does not exists or the result is not JSON or
non-existing, or the internal JSONP callback was called without any arguments,
the request fails with a generic JSONP Request Failed message. If you use
strict mode, the request also fails if the result is null and the webservice
can signal errors using `{"error":"Total Failure"}`.


Tested browsers
---------------

Open `tests.html` in your webbrowser to run the tests. Tested browsers:

 *  Google Chrome 11.0 for Linux
 *  Google Chrome 11.0 for Windows
 *  Firefox 3.6 for Linux
 *  MS Internet Explorer 6.0 [FAILS, probably in `common.step`]
